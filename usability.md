The main part of our website that stands out in terms of usability is the
navigation bar. Our navigation bar allows users to navigate the website easily
and efficiently with clear-cut, accessible icons for the home and own profile page
and other features.

In addition, the simplicity of our website in terms of colour highlights
potential interactions. For example, by making buttons like update and delete jobs
purple while the restof the website is on a very simple colour gradient 
(either grey or white) depending on mode, they are more emphasised to the user.
Also, hovering over buttons and clickable spans changes the cursor to pointer and
for spans, underlines, further emphasising the interactive elements of the website.

Dynamic like and watch buttons as mentioned in bonus also allow the user
to see at a glance whether they have liked a post or watched a person or not,
increasing accessiblity.

"Enter" button event listeners for watch email input and comments also allow
users to run typing inputs without needing to touch their mouse to click a button,
improving accessiblity.

As mentioned in the bonus, notification toggle allows users the choice of 
having notifications and the logout button on the navigation bar allows for 
quicker access. 

Success popups notify user of successful interactions, providing them with
clear confirmation.

Updating and creating jobs opening in a popup makes it obvious where inputs
should be placed.

General placement of buttons on the website is intuitive with no confusion
as to what the buttons link to.
